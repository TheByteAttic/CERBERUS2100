CERBERUS 2100™ is an educational multi-processor 8-bit computer, featuring both Z80 and 6502 CPUs, plus an AVR processor as I/O controller. Built with CPLDs, CERBERUS 2100™ is fully programmable even with respect to its hardware, at the individual gate and flip-flop level. It runs BASIC interpreters for both CPUs, but can also be used in a 'bare metal' mode through its built-in BIOS. It can even be extended through its expansion slot, which comes paired with a powerful, generic communications protocol that allows for Direct Memory Access (DMA). A detailed description of CERBERUS 2100™ is available in the <a href="https://github.com/TheByteAttic/CERBERUS2100/blob/main/CERBERUS%202100%20Hardware%20Manual.pdf">Hardware Manual</a>.<br><br>
CERBERUS 2100™ is a collaboration of three developers: Alexander Sharikhin (<a href="https://github.com/nihirash/cerberus-w65c02s-basic">6502 BASIC interpreter</a>, BIOS optimizations and test code optimizations), Dean Belfield (<a href="https://github.com/breakintoprogram/cerberus-bbc-basic">Z80 BASIC interpreter</a> and BIOS optimizations), and myself (hardware and original BIOS code). The <a href="https://github.com/TheByteAttic/CERBERUS2100/blob/main/CERBERUS%202100%20Hardware%20Manual.pdf">Hardware Manual</a> does not document the software, so you should visit <a href="https://github.com/nihirash/cerberus-w65c02s-basic">Alexander's</a> and <a href="https://github.com/breakintoprogram/cerberus-bbc-basic">Dean's</a> repositories for that.<br><br>
The applications in the directory <a href="https://github.com/TheByteAttic/CERBERUS2100/tree/main/Cerberus%20uSD%20card%20files">Cerberus uSD card files/</a> contain code from Alexander and Dean, but also software developed by others, namely: a <a href="https://github.com/lennart-benschop/cerberus-z80-forth">FORTH interpreter for CERBERUS 2100's Z80 CPU</a>, ported by Lennart Benschop, and the <a href="https://github.com/envenomator/cerberus2080-sokoban">SOKOBAN game ported also to CERBERUS 2100's Z80 CPU</a> by Jeroen Venema.<br><br>
CERBERUS 2100's BIOS code uses a modified version of the <a href="https://github.com/PaulStoffregen/PS2Keyboard">Arduino PS/2 Keyboard Library by Paul Stoffregen</a>, which we gratefully acknoeledge.
