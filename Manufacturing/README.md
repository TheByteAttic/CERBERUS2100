These are the files you need to have a CERBERUS 2100â„¢ board built and populated. To have it fully populated, use the 'Complete' BoM and pick & place files. The files marked 'minimal' contain only the small discrete components. This is useful if you can, and prefer to, drag-solder the main chips yourself, like I do.
