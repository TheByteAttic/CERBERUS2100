\
\ This serves as an introduction to Forth cross compiling, so it is extensively
\ commented.
\
\ This cross compiler can be run on any ANS Forth with the necessary
\ extension wordset that is at least 16-bit, including Z80 Forth.
\
\ It creates the memory image of a new Forth system that is to be run
\ by the Zilog Z80 processor.
\
\ The cross compiler (or meta compiler or target compiler) is similar
\ to a regular Forth compiler, except that it builds definitions in
\ a dictionary in the memory image of a different Forth system.
\ We call this the target dictionary in the target space of the
\ target system.
\
\ As the new definitions are for a different Forth system, the cross
\ compiler cannot EXECUTE them. Neither can it easily find the new
\ definitions in the target dictionary. Hence a shadow definition
\ for each target definition is made in the normal Forth dictionary.
\
\ The names of the new definitions overlap with the names of existing
\ elementary. Forth words. Therefore they need to be in a wordlist
\ different from the normal Forth wordlist.

\ PART 1: THE VOCABULARIES.

VOCABULARY TARGET
\ This vocabulary will hold shadow definitions for all words that are in
\ the target dictionary. When a shadow definition is executed, it
\ performs the compile action in the target dictionary.

VOCABULARY TRANSIENT
\ This vocabulary will hold definitions that must be executed by the
\ host system ( the system on which the cross compiler runs) and that
\ compile to the target system.

\ Expl: The word IF occurs in all three vocabularies. The word IF in the
\       FORTH vocabulary is run by the host system and is used when
\       compiling host definitions. A different version is in the
\       TRANSIENT vocabulary. This one runs on the host system and
\       is used when compiling target definitions. The version in the
\       TARGET vocabulary is the version that will run on the target
\       system.

\ PART 3: CREATING NEW DEFINITIONS IN THE TARGET SYSTEM.

\ These words create new target definitions, both the shadow definition
\ and the header in the target dictionary. The layout of target headers
\ can be changed but FIND in the target system must be changed accordingly.

\ All definitions are linked together in a number of threads. Each word
\ is linked in only one thread. Which thread the word is linked to, can be
\ determined from the name by a 'hash' code. To find a word, one can compute
\ the hash code and then one can search just one thread that contains a
\ small fraction of the words.

                           \ of the last definition in each thread.
