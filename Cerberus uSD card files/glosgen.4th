\G \G is an alias for \, so it is a comment till end-of-line, but
\G it has a special meaning for the Glossary Generator.

\G \G comments should appear immediately above or below the definition of
\G the word it belongs to. The definition line should contain no more
\G than the definition, a stack comment and a \ comment after which
\G the wordset and pronounciation.
\G An isolated block of \G comments is placed at the beginning of the
\G glossary file.

VARIABLE GLOSLIST 
VARIABLE CURRENT-COMMENT
VARIABLE FIXLINE

\ The Glossary entries in memory have the following form.
\ 1 cell: address of next entry, 1 cell: address of comment field
\ counted string: name counted string: stack picture 
\ counted string: extra field counted string: pronunciation.
